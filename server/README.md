### Backend Implementation

Create a simple platform with sign-in and sign-up flow that allows you to link your bank account using Mono, and view your transactions (using [manual data sync](https://docs.mono.co/docs/data-sync-1) and a cron job to fetch new transactions after every 3 hours is a plus).

A supporting node.js (typescript) REST API that securely provides data to the frontend service with the following resource;

1. A resource to sign up with email and a password
2. A resource to log in with the same password and email supplied during registration
3. A resource to save a linked account
4. A resource to fetch linked accounts of a user
5. A resource to fetch transactions of a userâ€™s linked account
6. A resource to unlink my account
7. A resource to delete my account from the platform

### SET-UP (To set up project on local)
In the terminal, you can run:
* git clone `https://github.com/Oluwa-Femi/fullstack-assessment`
* cd server(for backend)
* create a .env file in the root directory replicating the keys in the .env.sample file. Attach values to the keys. 
* npm install - to set up Node modules and install packages
* backend - run npm run start:dev - to spin the application
* onboard as a user by signing up
